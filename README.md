# My first blog!

Starting from the very scratches seems impossible, especially for someone who just turned 25 and is supposed to have a fullly developed career. 

Ever since I undestood what IT represents and what they have to offer in the labour market, I've shifted many of my assumptions. 

> First and foremost, who determines whether you're successful or not? I would dare say it is up to everyone's perspective. Never do you let anybody tell you that you're not enough for something.

With this blog, I've learnt the following:
- How to use git to retrieve and save any version of a project.
- The sheer power of github, which is a remote repository as well as a social network for developers. 
- How to get involved in open-source project and be proactive by collaborating with them. (This tool, AKA fork is awesome)
- In real projects, we are not likely to merge any branch directly to the main branch. On the contrary, we use an intermediate step called *pull request*. (Its name doen't make any sense, though)
- So far, this course has been the most challenging, every class leads me to think that I know nothing, which at the same time motivates me to never stop learning.
- I'm about to complete this course, it's a great way to finish this month.
- I'm super excited because it looks like I'm going to keep my position at Chevyplan. 
- Next week I'm going to switch to the Udemy course I purchased last year. 

**As a reminder,** this README.md was created with the firm porpuse of reminiscing how I used to practice my English skills. :)
